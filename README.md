## About the game
A while ago I made my own version of the world famous Pong in C#. This was because of a presentation I held for Dutch class, in which I talked about the creation of the original Pong and Atari, among other things. I thought it would be nice to create my own version of Pong and show this during the presentation.

Now, sometime later, I've created a new and improved version which uses MonoGame. It's not entirely faithful to the original, but it does the job.

You can! And finally, you also have the option to choose your opponent: another player or the computer. You can also let the computer play against itself.
